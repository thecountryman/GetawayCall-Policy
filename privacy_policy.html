    <p>Last Updated: February 2026</p>
    <p>Getaway Call ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use the Getaway Call application.</p>
    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>We do NOT collect, store, or share any personal information, voice recordings, or call transcripts. All call simulations are processed in real-time between your device and our secure AI API.</p>
    <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Our app uses secure AI APIs (OpenAI) to power the AI conversations. No individual identifying data is sent other than the text context you provide for the call simulation.</p>
    <h2>3. Local Storage</h2>
    <p>We store your subscription status and usage minutes locally on your device (using UserDefaults and Keychain) to manage your limits. This data never leaves your device except for iCloud backups (if enabled by you).</p>
    <h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our app does not target or knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13.</p>
